Colored Traceback
=================

Automatically color Python's uncaught exception tracebacks.

This one's for anybody who's ever struggled to read python's stacktraces on the
terminal. Something about the two-lines-per-frame approach really just makes
them tough to scan visually.

Compare this:

        main()
      File "./workflowy.py", line 37, in main

      File "./workflowy.py", line 153, in load_json
        return json.load(sys.stdin)

        raise ValueError("No JSON object could be decoded")
    ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

To this:

.. code-block:: python

        raise ValueError("No JSON object could be decoded")
    ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

Installation
------------

Through pip:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install colored-traceback

Or directly:

.. code-block:: bash

    git clone http://www.github.com/staticshock/colored-traceback.py
    python setup.py install

On Windows, which has no real support for ANSI escape sequences, there's an
additional dependency on `colorama`:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install colorama

Usage
-----

Colored Traceback works equally well within a script as it does when imported
directly in the interpreter REPL. Standard usage will color the output, unless
it's being redirected to a pipe:

.. code-block:: python

    import colored_traceback
    colored_traceback.add_hook()

If want to retain color even when stderr is being piped, tack on an
`always=True` argument:

.. code-block:: python

    import colored_traceback
    colored_traceback.add_hook(always=True)

There are also a couple of convenience imports, which get the footprint down to
one line:

.. code-block:: python

    # Same as add_hook()
    import colored_traceback.auto

    # Same as add_hook(always=True)
    import colored_traceback.always

It goes without saying that you might want to catch `ImportError`, making the
presence of the package optional:

.. code-block:: python

    try:
        import colored_traceback.auto
    except ImportError:
        pass
